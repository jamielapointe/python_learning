"""Simple Sort
To understand how efficient the built-in Python sorting function is, you
decided to implement your own simple sorting algorithm and compare its speed
to the speed of the Python sorting. Write a function that, given an array of
integers arr, sorts its elements in ascending order.

Hint: with Python it's possible to swap several elements in a single line. To
solve the task, use this knowledge to fill in both of the blanks (...).

Example

For arr = [2, 4, 1, 5], the output should be
solution(arr) = [1, 2, 4, 5].
"""


def solution(arr):

    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n):
        j = 0
        stop = n - i
        while j < stop - 1:
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
            j += 1
    return arr


print(solution([2, 4, 1, 5]))
